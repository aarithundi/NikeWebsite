							<h3>LeBron James x Kylian Mbappé<small> posted on Jan 11th, 2021</small></h3>

								<p>The Chosen 2 pack contains both basketball and football footwear, which highlights the impact that both James and Mbappé will have on the next generation.<br><br>The Lebron 18 ‘The Chosen 2’ basketball shoe comes with a Knitposite 2.0 upper, translucent sole and a double Nike swoosh on the forefoot, and also pays homage to LeBron James and Kylian Mbappé with a Lebron x Kylian graphic printed on the heel of the shoe.<br><br>The Mbappé Mercurial also pays homage to the two icons with a KM x LBJ symbol on the heel, as well as having a ‘Chosen One’ logo on the boots toe. The shoes sole comes in a futuristic silver and blue, and with two of the Nike swooshes sitting on top of each other.<br><br>Lebron James, 36, has been a superstar of the NBA scene for over 17 years, and has competed in an incredible 10 NBA finals. He had won the NBA Most Valuable Player award four times, making him one of the greatest basketball players of his generation. Kylian Mbappé, who’s still only 22, announced himself to the football world during the 2016/17 season by scoring 26 goals in 44 games in all competitions when he was just 18 years old. He subsequently made the £162m transfer from AS Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, making him the second most expensive transfer in history.<br><br>Between the two of them, they mass a collective 122 million followers on Instagram. Ahead of the release of the Nike Chosen 2 pack on January 9th, James and Mbappé swapped profile pictures on the app, as part of a successful marketing campaign that captured the imagination of sports fans around the meaning behind the secretive move.
								Mbappé hopes that the partnership will serve as an inspiration:“LeBron is a unique champion and I have the deepest respect for him on, but also off the court,” Kylian Mbappe said.<br><br>“He is an inspiration to me. From Akron to Paris, we are both taking action to move the lines in our society and offer a better world to the younger generation. I truly hope our common message will have a strong social impact and this is just the beginning of our stories”<br><br>As part of the collaboration, Nike will also make a donation to the LeBron James Family Foundation as well as Mbappé’s IBKM Foundation. 
								<br><br>The Lebron James Family Foundation was set up to help students from Lebron’s hometown of Akron, Ohio by providing them with programmes, support and mentors they need to succeed in school and further on in their life. <br><br>Kylian Mbappé’s IBKM Foundation was set up by players to help 98 - the number relates to the year of his birth - Parisian children achieve their goals with financial support.</p>
